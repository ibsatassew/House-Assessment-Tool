Assurant Challenge
Challenge 1 â€“ AI Driven House Assessment
Implement Multi-Mode Generative AI technology to evaluate the health of a property through image analysis and feature examination. This project aims to effectively distill critical information, presenting a clear summary of a house's overall state and specific issues.

Additionally, the project will focus on:

1. Summarizing the overall health of the house using photographic and text data.
2. Promptly identifying and diagnosing immediate structural or functional concerns.
3. Predicting and highlighting potential issues likely to arise within a 3-6 month timeframe.
4. Generating the top three insights as tailored maintenance and protection recommendations for homeowners, based on the individual condition of their house.
